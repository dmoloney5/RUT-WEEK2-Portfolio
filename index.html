              Hello I'm Dennis Moloney.  I have been in the I.T. field for over 25 years.  I graduated from a technical institute for pc repair right out of H.S.   I started this career with a little company building computers and supporting them.  Since then I have had multiple contract work doing various I.T. related jobs which help me gather the knowledge of hardware, software and networking.
              I joined a large corporation in 2006 as just a field technician.  In my third year there I became the field support with a title Tier 3.  I was the only Tier 3 technician in the northeast region.  Just 3 years later I became the IT Manager of the field support.  We handled 52 offices in NJ and over 3000 users.
              Once I left there I was working for a small SaaS company.  My job was been the whole IT department.  I worked closely with the development team and had interest in learning web design.
              I'm currently in Rutgers University learning to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  Below you will find the project I've worked on.  This website is my first front end website I coded.
